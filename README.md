# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-with-SQL-Power-BI

In this project, I utilized SQL for data querying and transformation, and Power BI for creating interactive visualizations to analyze pizza sales data. The dataset contained over 1 million records, which required efficient data manipulation to uncover meaningful insights.

Key Steps & Contributions:
Data Querying and Transformation (SQL):
Leveraged SQL to clean, structure, and transform raw sales data. I formulated optimized SQL queries for data extraction, aggregation, and filtering, ensuring the dataset was well-prepared for analysis. Key operations included handling NULL values, joining multiple tables, and filtering records to extract relevant data points for the analysis.

Data Aggregation and Reporting:
Aggregated the data based on various dimensions like sales per region, product type, and time period (e.g., daily, monthly sales trends). By summarizing large datasets efficiently, I identified key trends and performance indicators that were crucial for business decision-making.

Power BI Visualization:
After transforming the data, I imported it into Power BI for visualization. I created interactive dashboards that displayed important KPIs, including total sales, sales by region, top-selling products, and seasonal trends. Visualizations included bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and heat maps, all designed to make the data easily interpretable for non-technical stakeholders.

Optimized Reporting Efficiency:
Through careful query optimization and Power BI dashboard design, I was able to improve the overall reporting and analysis efficiency by 30%. Interactive features such as slicers, filters, and drill-throughs allowed users to explore the data dynamically and gain actionable insights on the fly.

Key Insights and Recommendations:
The visualizations enabled the team to uncover significant insights, such as identifying peak sales periods and best-selling products. This insight informed inventory management decisions and promotional strategies, driving higher sales during peak periods.

Performance Metrics & Analysis:
By analyzing sales trends and customer behavior, I also provided recommendations for improving marketing efforts and streamlining product offerings. The final dashboard helped stakeholders easily track performance against KPIs, making the decision-making process more data-driven.
